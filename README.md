SHOPPER CHALLENGE
-----------------

To get up and running hit `bundle install && rails s` - the app
should be running at http://localhost:3000. The front-end
of the application is build with react and react-router. It's served
from application#index. The routes for the front-end part are stored in
./components/routes.js.jsx.
